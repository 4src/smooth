# Analysis Twins

_A is really B_
- stuff for _A_ can be used for _B_ (and vide versa)
_ there is a simpler way to do _A_ and _B_
- that simpler way is somehow better (easier to build, faster to run, better performance)

## Clutering and Naive Bayes

Clustering = grouping together similar rows.

NB = group together all the rows from each class.

NB + Clustering:
- data structures used for clustering can serve as the classifier.

## explanation = cluster + contrast

## test case generation = cluster + sub-sample

## fairness = cluster + sub-sample

## optimzation = cluster + chop

## anomaly detection = cluster + outlier

## Naive Bayes = outlier

## explore = classify + boundary check
